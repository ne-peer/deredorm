It's working on [deredorm.ne-peer.com](http://deredorm.ne-peer.com/)

This project made by Angular, Material2 and Firebase platform.  
Was generated with angular-cli version 1.0.0-beta.28.3.

## Special thanks
To develop this project, we used resource below. Thank you!

## Deployment
```bash
$ ng build --prod --output-hashing all
```

> --output-hashing all
>
> hash contents of the generated files and append hash to the file name to facilitate browser cache busting (any change to file content will result in different hash and hence browser is forced to load a new version of the file)

## Development

### Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive/pipe/service/class/module`.

### Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

### Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

### Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.

### Deploying to GitHub Pages

Run `ng github-pages:deploy` to deploy to GitHub Pages.
